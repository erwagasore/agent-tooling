# Agents Guide: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

This file is the operating guide for humans and AI assistants working in this repo.
It should evolve with the project.

## Principles
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Keep behaviour changes documented (README and/or CHANGELOG).
- If you introduce a new tool, dependency, or convention, update this file.

## Workflow
- Start work on a new branch (never commit directly to main unless explicitly instructed).
- Push to remote only when the solution is ready for review.
- Merge via PR.

## Repo map
Document the important parts of the repository.

- `src/` (or equivalent): main code
- `tests/`: tests
- `docs/`: documentation
- `scripts/`: automation
- `infra/` or `deploy/`: deployment
- `assets/`: static assets

(Adjust to match the actual repo.)

## How to run
- Build:
- Test:
- Lint/format:
- Start (dev):
- Start (prod):

## Conventions
- Naming:
- Error handling:
- Logging/observability:
- Configuration:
- Versioning/release process:

## Definition of done
A change is “done” when:
- It works locally
- Tests pass (or are updated)
- Docs updated if behaviour changed
- No secrets committed

## Decision log
Record notable decisions and trade-offs.

- YYYY-MM-DD — Decision: … / Reason: … / Trade-offs: …
